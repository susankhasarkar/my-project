            <p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos is an American business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. Bezos is the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, having previously served as chairman, president and CEO of the company. Jeffrey Preston Bezos (/ˈbeɪzoʊs/ BAY-zohss;[2] né Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964)[3] is an American business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. Bezos is the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, having previously served as chairman, president and CEO of the company. With a net worth of about $200 billion as of August 2021, he is the richest person in the world according to both Forbes and Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.[4]

                Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. He holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994, on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the world's largest provider of virtual assistants[5] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.
                
                Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015, and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth. The company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[6] He also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions.
                
                The first centibillionaire on the Forbes wealth index,[7] Bezos was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018.[8] In August 2020, according to Forbes, he had a net worth exceeding $200 billion.[9] In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bezos's wealth grew by approximately $24 billion.[10] On July 5, 2021, Bezos stepped down as the CEO of Amazon and transitioned into the role of executive chairman; Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon's cloud computing division,[11][12] replaced Bezos as the CEO of Amazon. On July 20, 2021, Jeff Bezos flew to space alongside his brother Mark Bezos.[13] The suborbital flight lasted over 10 minutes, reaching a peak altitude of 66.5 miles (107.0 km).[14]
